## [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
Udemy is an E-learning platform with user-made courses that other users can purchase. It solves the problem of teaching aspiring entrepreneurs applicable skills to create their company.

However, our platform is different because it is specialized for aspiring African entrepreneurs, has community features, all while being free for the users. Community features are important because most Udemy courses are just videos, with minimal interaction with the instructor. Our platform provides users constant engagement with the instructors and the course content, so the aspiring African entrepreneurs succeed.

Udemy did not focus on providing more interaction with the instructor because the ratio of course creators to students is too large.

For Udemy to provide more interaction possibilities between instructors and students, it would require a large amount of time and money.


## [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/h)
Google Classroom is a free web service that aims to simplify creating distributing, and grading assignments. The primary purpose of Google Classroom is to streamline the process of sharing files between instructors and students.

However, our platform is different because it is specialized for aspiring African entrepreneurs, is optimized for modular learning and has a profile feature for both entrepreneurs, partners and companies. With our modular learning, entrepreneurs are able to learn at their own pace and be able to learn more effectively. Additionally with our profile feature, users are able to network more efficiently and effectively.
	
Google Classroom did not focus on providing networking features because the software is designed for K-12 learning. Students that age typically are not going to need networking features for job seeking. For Google Classroom to provide networking features, it would take a moderate amount of resources.


## [Canvas](https://www.canvas.net)

Canvas is a course management system that supports online learning and teaching. It allows professors to post grades, information, and assignments online. While students can take quizzes, submit assignments and view their grades on the platform.

Our platform is different because it is specialized for aspiring African entrepreneurs, and we have a direct message feature. With the direct message feature, we can keep all communications on the platform, improving user privacy, while improving quality of life on our platform. Additionally our platform is completely free, while Canvas is not free for institutions.

Canvas did not focus on providing a direct message feature because they chose to use an email system instead. If Canvas were to implement a direct message feature, it would require a moderate amount of resources.


## [Zoom](https://zoom.us)
Zoom is a cloud-based video conferencing tool that lets users host virtual one-on-one or team meetings easily. With audio, video and collaboration features, this remote communication tool connects remote team members with each other.

Our platform is different because it provides a learning platform rather than just  video conferencing. With our platform, users can learn at their own pace, while being able to see all their lectures and assignments in one place. Entrepreneurs, partners and companies can also effectively network with each other using our profile feature. Additionally, our platform is free, while Zoom for institutions is not.

Zoom did not focus on implementing e-learning features because that is not the purpose of their product. Their product is simply designed for video conferencing, but e-learning instructors use Zoom to deliver their material. For Zoom to implement e-learning features would be to pivot their entire company, which is incredibly unfeasible. 


 ## [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/)
LinkedIn is an online business and employment-oriented service that is mainly used for professional networking, and allows job seekers to post their resum√©s and employers to post jobs.

Our platform is different because it is specialized for aspiring African entrepreneurs, has modular learning with user created content, and a calendar system so users can keep track of their todo list. With our user created content, entrepreneurs can request a module be made for a specific topic, that way instructors on the platform know which topics to teach. Additionally, with our calendar feature, both instructors and entrepreneurs can keep up to date with all the tasks that need to be completed, for a more engaging learning and teaching experience.

LinkedIn did not focus on providing a platform for user created lessons because LinkedIn wants to keep their lessons standardized and relatively short. For LinkedIn to provide a platform for user created lessons would take a large amount of resources. However, for LinkedIn to implement a calendar system for a todo list, would take a small amount of resources.
