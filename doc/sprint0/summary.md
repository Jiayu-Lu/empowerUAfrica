## Project Objective

Our project objective is to build a platform to teach aspiring entrepreneurs in Africa how to create a successful business.
As well as connecting them to potential investors in order to enable them to build market-creating innovations which tackle their country's biggest challenges with technology.

## The Key Personas
> Adaora, age 28, lives in South Africa and is a freelance music producer. She performs in a local bar every night and is well-known in the community where she lives. Besides singing some pop music, she often performs her self-composed songs. She has participated in music festivals held by several entertainment companies and met many people who love music as much as she does.

> Bosco is a 32 year old software programmer. He is a member of the development team of video software “TikTok” at ByteDance. He hopes to create his own software company to introduce a greater social media platform to the African world.

> Helen, age 40, is a senior instructor at Franklin A.Trevor college. She has been teaching courses related to management for ten years. She thinks online teaching can provide as good of a learning experience to students as in-person teaching.

## The Key Scenarios
> Adaora wants to work with people that share her passion for music to create a joint venture music company to promote their art to the entire world. She hopes to learn about company operations to help her start a business.

> Bosco believes he understands his home country well enough to start a successful social media platform. He is familiar with software development but knows little about how to run a company. He wants to acquire some professional knowledge on the business administration side of a company.

> During the pandemic, Helen has to teach courses online. She has no online teaching experience but is willing to try it. She does not know the intricacies of online teaching as well as in-person teaching. She wants to find an easy-to-use platform to start her new career.

## The Key Principles
 * User Experience over Saving Expense - The design should provide a great user experience even if it incurs an expense or inefficiency.

 * Learnability - The design should be intuitive and easy-to-learn to novice users with little to no technological experience. 

 * Efficiency - The design should be designed in a way that helps users perform tasks efficiently and with little error.

 * Modularity - The design should be conducive to a user's learning and modular so a user can perform small tasks freely.

 * Community Connection - The design should establish and reinforce connections between users, forming a community among them.

 * User Engagement - Keep users engaged with the content so they do not fall behind.
