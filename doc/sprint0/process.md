# How did you organize the team?  

At the beginning of the sprint, we each declare what tasks we would like to do, based on our interests and skills. Based on our declarations we will divide up the work evenly. If there is a conflict on a task, we will hold a discussion with the whole group to decide who shall get the task. If we cannot resolve the issue based on the discussion, the task will get decided by a coinflip.

# Which tools did you use, if any?  

We use google drive to share group documents that contain a write-up component, so that everyone can read and edit.  

We use Balsamiq Wireframe to design the user interface and may change to another tool in the later phase if there is a need.  



# How did you make decisions?  

When there is an important decision that should be made, we would hold a meeting and discuss it. The decision can be made if everyone is satisfied. If group members do have different opinions towards the decision, we would reach out to the project manager, TAs or the professor to get instructions. After consulting the project manager TAs or the professor, we would hold another discussion. If after this discussion we would hold a vote, and since our group has 5 members, there will be no ties.  



# How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?  

The list of prioritizations are in order of most important to least.  

We first prioritize the user stories that are about the bare bones of our program.  

Secondly, we then prioritize the user stories that are about the basics of a functionality.  

Thirdly, we will perform a cost benefit analysis on the remaining user stories, and we will implement the ones with the most benefit with little time.  

Finally, we will implement the user stories that are beneficial to the user experience.  




# How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?  

Normally we do not need to vote, our discussions lead to a consensus. If we do need to vote, we would only need 1 round of voting since our group consists of 5 members, therefore there would not be any ties.  


# How frequently did you meet?  

Generally, once a week, but additional meetings can happen if there is a need.
We normally meet on Friday night(10 P.M) to present the work that has been done so far to other group members, so that we can give others advice on how to improve the work.

Fact:

The first meeting was on May 20. It was about the implementation of team contract, team.md and task assignment.

The second meeting was on May 22. It was about the startup of UI, user stories, personas, competition and summary.

The third meeting was on May 24. It was about integration and improvement of the component in the second meeting. We also began to write process.md and readme.md in this meeting.

The last meeting was on May 27. It was about the conclusion of the whole sprint0. We did a final check on each document and submitted them after we were all satisfied.

# What lessons should you take forward to the next phase? 

We learned to start the work early, and try to get the bulk of the work done at the start. It is a lot easier to make smaller modifications once there is less time constraint.

We also learned that we should plan out what we need to complete before the next meeting, that way we can stick to the schedule and be able to coordinate well.

We learned that we can have more effective communications by having a specific person be the instigator of conversations.

We learned that when different opinions are generated in the team, we need to be willing to listen to each other and make appropriate adjustments and integrations to the final plan.
